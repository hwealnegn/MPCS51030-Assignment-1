# hwealnegn-MPCS51030-Winter-2015-Assignment-1

Grade: 9.5/10

It looks like you worked on the homework on the website (Apple's tutorial) as well as the one at the end of the slides! This is good practice, but for future reference, you only need to submit the homework included on the website as the decks are sometimes outdated from previous quarters. The grade and notes included here are for "HelloWorld."

The code is clear and follows the assignment very closely. The only issue is, as the professor pointed out in class, this tutorial is a little outdated and recommends some things that are no longer best practices, e.g. the line "@synthesize userName = _userName" (see the class' Github forum or Lecture 1 slides for more details on this).
